SkillCraft Technology Data Science Task 1 – World Population Visualization in Power BI

This repository contains my Task 1 submission for the Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology.
The task was to visualize the distribution of categorical and continuous variables using bar charts and histograms in Power BI.

"Objective"
Analyze the world population distribution across countries and continents.
Compare regions based on Population Percentage (%), Growth Rate, and Geographical Area (km²).
Build interactive dashboards to make global population insights easier to understand.

"Tools & Technologies"
-> Microsoft Excel → Data preparation and formatting.
-> Power BI Desktop → Dashboard creation and visualization.

"Contents"
-> world_population.csv → Dataset file.
-> World_Population.pbix → Power BI project file.
-> Powerbi.png → Exported screenshot of the dashboard.

"Dashboard Insights"
'Country & Continent-Level Visuals'
-> Country wise Area Distribution (km²)
    A line chart displaying the geographical size of countries.
    Highlights countries with the largest land areas (e.g., Russia, Canada, China, USA, Brazil).

-> Continent wise Population % and Growth Rate
    A clustered bar chart comparing population share by continent with growth rate trends.
    Asia and Africa show higher population percentages and growth rates, while Oceania has minimal contribution.

"Knowledge Gained"
-> Differentiating between categorical (continent, country) and continuous (population, growth rate, area) data.
-> Creating interactive dashboards in Power BI with filters and multiple chart types.
-> Applying comparative analysis to show how area, population, and growth relate at different levels.
-> Designing dashboards that are both visually clear and insightful.

This project helped me gain practical experience in data visualization, dashboard design, and comparative analysis using Power BI.
